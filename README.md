# UMask-AFL
It is an ongoing project we're working on by taking AFL as a baseline. Our project work is basically finding the masked reachable targets by unmasking them. Means finding targets which were masked AFL failed to detect. Here target means assert(0) statement we injected into some places in a program. 

The folder named "programs" contains an artificial dataset of C programs to test to work on in which targets are already injected.

We'll upload our project shortly.
