# UMask-AFL
It is an ongoing project we're working on by taking AFL as a baseline. Our project work is basically finding the unmasked reachable targets. Means finding targets which were masked in AFL. Here target means assert(0) statement we injected into some places in a program. It contains an artificial dataset of C programs to test to work on.

We'll upload our project shortly.
